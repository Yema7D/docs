    st.write("""
    Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines the strengths of retrieval-based methods and generative models to improve the performance of natural language processing tasks. This approach enhances the model's ability to generate accurate and contextually relevant responses by incorporating external knowledge from a retrieval system.

    st.subheader("How RAG Works")
    st.write("""
    - **Retrieval Component**: The retrieval system searches a large corpus of documents or knowledge base to find relevant information based on the input query. This step helps the model to access up-to-date and factual information that might not be present in its training data.
    - **Generative Component**: The generative model, typically a transformer-based language model, uses the retrieved documents as additional context to generate a response. This allows the model to produce more informed and accurate outputs.

    st.subheader("Benefits of RAG")
    st.write("""
    - **Enhanced Accuracy**: By leveraging external knowledge, RAG models can generate more accurate and factually correct responses.
    - **Improved Contextual Understanding**: The retrieval component provides additional context, enabling the model to understand and respond to queries better.
    - **Scalability**: RAG can be applied to a wide range of tasks and domains by updating the retrieval corpus with relevant information.

    st.subheader("Applications of RAG")
    st.write("""
    RAG can be applied in various scenarios where accurate and context-aware responses are crucial. Some applications include:
    - **Question Answering**: Providing precise answers to user queries by retrieving relevant documents and generating informed responses.
    - **Customer Support**: Enhancing chatbot responses with up-to-date information from knowledge bases.
    - **Content Creation**: Assisting in generating content by providing contextually relevant information from external sources.

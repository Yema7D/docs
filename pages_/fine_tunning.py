    Fine-tuning is the process of taking a pre-trained language model and adapting it to a specific task or dataset. This involves training the model on a new dataset, usually with a smaller learning rate, to make the model perform better on the new task while retaining the knowledge it acquired during pre-training.

    st.write("""
    1. **Prepare the Dataset**: Collect and preprocess the dataset relevant to the task. This might involve cleaning the data, tokenizing text, and splitting it into training and validation sets.
    2. **Load the Pre-trained Model**: Use a pre-trained language model as the base. Common choices include GPT, BERT, or other transformer-based models.
    3. **Configure Training Parameters**: Set up the training parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.
    4. **Train the Model**: Fine-tune the model on the new dataset. This step involves adjusting the model's weights based on the new data.
    5. **Evaluate the Model**: Assess the performance of the fine-tuned model on a validation set to ensure it has learned the new task effectively.
    6. **Deploy the Model**: Once fine-tuning is complete and the model performs well, it can be deployed for use in applications.

    - **Overfitting**: The model may overfit the new dataset, especially if it is small. Regularization techniques and careful monitoring can help mitigate this.
    - **Catastrophic Forgetting**: The model might lose some of the knowledge it acquired during pre-training. Techniques like Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) can help preserve important weights.
    - **Resource Intensive**: Fine-tuning can be computationally expensive, requiring significant time and resources.

    - **Use a Learning Rate Scheduler**: Adjust the learning rate during training to improve convergence.
    - **Data Augmentation**: Increase the size and diversity of the training dataset through data augmentation techniques.
    - **Regularization Techniques**: Apply techniques such as dropout and weight decay to prevent overfitting.
    - **Cross-Validation**: Use cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.

    Fine-tuning can be applied in various scenarios to adapt pre-trained models for specific tasks, such as:
    - **Natural Language Understanding**: Enhancing models for tasks like sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and question answering.
    - **Content Generation**: Adapting models for generating context-specific content, such as marketing copy or creative writing.
    - **Specialized Domains**: Fine-tuning models for domain-specific tasks in fields like healthcare, finance, and law.
